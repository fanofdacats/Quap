Welcome to Discord Coding! Here is where you will program your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game!



A quick breakdown of all the files contained here:

-README.md: you are here! This is the text file meant as an explainer for a program.

-TODO.md: another text file - this is for you to keep a running log of changes or additions that you want to make to your program.

FILES YOU WILL MODIFY: 
-.env: this is the file that stores the unique identifiers for your program, for your bot, and for your Discord server. Data kept in .env files are to be kept PRIVATE and not stored elsewhere.

-commands.js: where COMMANDS (abilities of your bot) are initialized/created. This is where we define SLASH COMMANDS that we'll use in Discord.

-app.js where commands (abilities) and buttons are handled. This is where we define the BEHAVIOR of a certain command --> for example, what happens when a user interacts with the "hello" command?



FILES YOU WILL NOT MODIFY 
-utils.js: code to connect to Discord, as well as code to save a game for your bot. 
IMPORTANT: do not change code to utils.js unless directly instructed.

-IMPORTANT NOTE - Two other files here, "PACKAGE.JSON" and ".GITIGNORE" include special information that help the game run on Discord correctly. 
Do not modify, delete, or add anything to these files!
